          Perhaps the greatest success story of solving of climate change is one by the WWF, short
          for the World Wide Fund for Nature. WWF is a non-governmental organization whose main
          goal is to promote environmental conservation. Since its foundation in 1961, WWF is the
          primary driving force behind many of the environmental activism and conservation
          campaigns.
          <br \><br \>
          One of WWF's campaigns involves targeting politicians in control of the
          government, changing their mindset and pressuring them to act before climate change
          happens catastrophically. To do so, WWF ensured that the goal of keeping greenhouse gas
          levels within the limits is mentioned during the first international agreement on climate
          change. WWF has also started a program called Climate Savers in which it spearheaded
          the movement for large corporations to decrease their greenhouse gases emissions. This
          worked exceptionally well as the equivalent to Switzerland's annual emissions has been
          saved thanks to the program.
          <br \><br \>
          Apart from changing the political climate, the WWF has also made tremendous progress in
          the conservation of forests. It worked with multiple companies in the UK to ensure that
          their timber products come from well-managed forests, saving the ecosystem from
          unrecoverable damage and the lack of trees for CO<sub>2</sub> absorption. To further
          regulate the timber market, the WWF formed the FSC, or the Forest Stewardship Council, to
          brand wooden products which meet sustainability standards.
          <br \><br \>
          Although us individuals are less powerful than the WWF when it comes to conservation
          activism, we can stand together to demand action from the government and corporations.
          Since the government and corporations rely heavily on everyday individuals for their
          success, they will be willing to change as long as we all stand together and demand so.
          <br \><br \>

          of the WWF.
